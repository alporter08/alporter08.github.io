title: MTA Turnstile Data
---

My first project at Metis involved a hypothetical scenario in which a client focusing on fundraising for the promotion of women in tech wanted to make use of MTA turnstile data in order to maximize the collection of email addresses from passers-by by making use of street teams positioned at subway stations throughout NYC.

## Defining the the objective ##
The problem statement was quite open-ended, and my instructors pointed out that in real-life instances clients often look to you, the data scientist, for guidance on how best to tackle a certain problem. With that in mind, my team (Karl Rudeen and Max Kneissl) and I set out to specifically define the objective of our work so that both the client and ourselves would know exactly what we would be producing.

```
Objective: Provide WTWY with a selection of locations at given subway stations in order to maximize the collection 
of email addresses by allocated volunteers primarily using MTA turnstile data and additional data sources.
```
